# LAZY TACO BOWLS

## STEP ZERO: SHOPPING

### SHOPPING LIST

* 1 lb ground beef (less fatty is better**) or ground turkey
* Greens (you probably already have some spinach, so you can just throw some of that in, or you can try some shredded cabbage)
* [optional] Shredded cheese (you also probably already have this)

## STEP ONE: RICE

* Measure out 2 cups of brown rice and throw it in a rice cooker
* Measure our 4 cups of water and thow it in *the same* rice cooker
* Turn on that rice cooker for brown rice.
* Wait.  This will probably take a while.

## STEP TWO: MEAT

* Go get a pan, preferably a large one.
* Turn on the heat to medium.
* Go find a spatula or a wooden spoon and put it next to the stove.
* Remember that ground beef (or turkey)?  Well go get it.
* Put the ground meat in the pan.
* Grab the bag of taco seasoning I sent you.
* Throw that in the pan too.
* Take the spatula and break up the meat and mix the spices in as it cooks.
* The meat is done when it's no longer pink.

## STEP THREE: VEGGIES

* Open the two cans of beans, the can of corn, and the jar of salsa into a bowl.
* Mix.

## STEP FOUR: BOWLING

To make one bowl:

* Put a serving of rice on the bottom.
* Add some of the bean mixture.
* Add some of the ground beef.
* Top with greens and shredded cheese as desired.

## STEP FIVE: STORAGE

* Perform the instructions under step 4 (skip the greens), but make them in the tupperware I sent.
* Store them in the fridge (or freezer if you get bored of them)
* Reheat them in the microwave 1 minute at a time until they reach the desired temperature.
